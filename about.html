				<p>Here is my photography website as a final project for the Front End Web Development course at General Assembly (Autumn 2013). I have chosen Nixie One as a font (thanks Google) for its clean and simple look which doesn't interfere with the images. When you hover over pictures, opacity changes to 0.8, while textshadow is applied when you hover over the navigation bar links. In the about page, clicking on my email opens up a new message window filling in automatically the address and the title of the mail. The html and CSS is responsive, filling the browser window's width, and the photos are arranged based on a simple grid system. The navigation bar also changes when screen is smaller than 1000px. In terms of Javascript, I have used mouse events so when one clicks on an photo, that opens up on full screen, which I think works best to look at photos without distractions. To navigate the gallery one can use both mouse clicks and keyboard arrows. The transition between one image and the next one is done using fade in/out methods and a different class is applied in the background to landscape/portrait photos. Access on mobile works fine, but I haven't been able to add touch gestures and full screen is more difficult to handle. Ultimately, I would like to develop this as a fully-flexed web app, so if you have suggestions, please send them through using the link here below.</p>
